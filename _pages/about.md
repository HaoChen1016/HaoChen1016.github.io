Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical and aerospace engineering with the school of mechanical and aerospace engineering, Oklahoma State University, advised by [associate professor Dr.He Bai](https://ceat.okstate.edu/mae/faculty-staff/faculty-bios/he-bai.html). I received the B.E. degree in Automation from Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, Sichuan, China in 2019. My research includes navigation, localization, Bayesian estimation, distributed estimation, sensor/data fusion and control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).

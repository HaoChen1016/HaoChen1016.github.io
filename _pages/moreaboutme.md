### I like
- traveling. Enjoying the beautiful scenery can help me relax and experiencing local cultural customs can help me maintain my curiosity about the world.
- dogs/cats. I am a dog/cat person and one of my dream is to adopt a cat and a dog when I am financially independent.
- computer games. League of legends enjoyer.
- fitness. I usually work out and it can keep me energetic.
- Music. Listening to music is a good way to relax.
